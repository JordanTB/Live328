## About Live328

Live328 is designed to help raise awareness of human trafficking around the world, but especially within North America.

## Our Purpose

Many many years ago, slavery was abolished. However, in the 21st century, it is clear that there are still many people living in slavery; In fact, human trafficking is one of the fastest growing crimes in the world.

The majority of human trafficking is sexual trafficking or forced labour, combined accounting for around 90% of all reported cases. UNICEF estimates that there are 21 million trafficked people around the world. 5.5 million of them being children. Human trafficking is a $32 billion dollar a year global industry. Second only to drugs trafficking.

The issue however, is that human trafficking is a severely under-reported crime. There could be, and likey is, much more of it than we could ever imaging. Hence Live328. Our sole purpose is to bring awareness to human trafficking and the organizations working to eradicate it.
